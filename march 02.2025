If a receiving host fails to receive all the segments that it should acknowledge, the host can improve the communication session by decreasing the window size.
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are protocols that work at the Transport layer and will be covered in detail in Chapter 6.
Devices used in an Internetwork The following network devices operate at all seven layers of the OSI model: 
■ Network management stations (NMSs) 
■ Web and application servers
■ Gateways (not default gateways) 
■ Network hosts Several devices operate primarily at the Physical layer of the OSI model. 
These devices manipulate mainly the physical aspects of a network data stream—things like voltages,signal direction, and signal strength. 

The following four devices are the most popular and will be detailed in Chapter 5, “Networking Devices”: 
■ Network interface cards (NICs)
■ Transceivers
■ Repeaters
■ Hubs

That routers break up broadcast domains and switches break up collision domains.
Each router interface is a broadcast domain. Routers break up broadcast domains by default and provide WAN services. 
Internet WAN Services Here are some key points about routers that you really should commit to memory: 
■ Routers, by default, won’t forward any broadcast or multicast packets. 
■ Routers use the logical address in a Network layer header to determine the next-hop router to forward the packet to.
■ Routers can use access lists, created by an administrator, to control security on the types of packets that are allowed to enter or exit an interface.
■ Routers can provide Layer 2 bridging functions if needed and can simultaneously route through the same interface. 
■ Layer 3 devices (routers, in this case) provide connections between virtual LANs (VLANs). 
■ Routers can provide quality of service (QoS) for specific types of network traffic.   

A router can also be referred to as a Layer 3 switch. These terms are interchangeable.

Chapter 3. 
Note that the only difference between T568A and T568B is that pairs 2 and 3 (orange and green) are swapped. 
Also, you can use a UTP coupler in order to connect two RJ-45 connectors together to lengthen a cable or in order to make a straight-through cable into a crossover, 
and vice versa. If you’re thinking, “What’s the difference, and why does it matter?” the answer is the position of four wires on one side of the cable—that’s it!  
If you’re installing new cabling to each cubicle and/or office, you need to make sure to connect all eight pins—and use Cat 5e or Cat 6. 
Voice over IP (VoIP) uses all eight pins, and it’s really common to have voice and data on the same wire at the same time in today’s networks. 
Pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 are used in both standards. They are needed for 1000BaseT, PoE, and specialized versions of 100 Mbps networks.
You’re going to find out a lot more about how important it is to label basically everything. 
But for now, make sure to label a crossover cable as what it is so that no one tries to use it as a workstation patch cable. If they do that, 
the workstation won’t be able to communicate with the hub and the rest of the network!
