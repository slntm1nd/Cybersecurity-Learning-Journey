Networking Fundamentals (2 hours)
March 1 (Day 1): Introduction to Networking (OSI model, TCP/IP)
* Study: CompTIA Network+ Study Guide (Chapters 1-3)
    * https://ramtiin.ir/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompTIA-Network-Study-Guide-Exam-N10-007.pdf
    * Time: 2 hours
* Hands-on: Set up basic network (AWS Free Tier or local VM) to configure IP addressing.
    * Resource: AWS Free Tier or create a local virtual machine using VirtualBox.
    * Time: 1 hour
    
    The terms workstation , client , and host can sometimes be used interchangeably. 
    Computers have become more and more powerful and the terms have become somewhat fuzzy because hosts can be clients
    , workstations, servers, and more! The term host is used to describe pretty much anything that takes an IP address.
    Also notice that the hosts can access the servers across the network, which is pretty much the general idea of having a network in the fi st place! 
You probably picked up on the fact that there are more workstations here than servers, right? 
Think of why that is. If you answered that it’s because one server can provide resources to what can sometimes be a huge number of individual users at the same time but workstations don’t, you nailed it!
WANs are so important that I have dedicated an entire chapter to them: Chapter 16, “Wide Area Networks.
By the way, fault tolerance is the capability of a computer or a network system to respond to a condition automatically, 
often resolving it, which reduces the impact on the system. I
f fault-tolerance measures have been implemented correctly on a network, it’s highly unlikely that any of that network’s users will know that a problem ever existed at all.
A full mesh physical topology is least likely to have a collision, which happens when the data from two hosts trying to communicate simultaneously “collides” and gets lost.
Know your network topologies. Know the names and descriptions of the topologies. 
Be aware of the difference between physical networks (what humans see) and logical networks (what the equipment “sees”). 
Know the advantages and disadvantages of the topologies. It is important to know what each topology brings to the table. 
Knowing the various characteristics of each topology comes in handy during troubleshooting. Understand the terms LAN and WAN. 
You need to understand when you would use a LAN and when you would use a WAN. 
A LAN is used to connect a group of hosts together, and a WAN is used to connect various LANs together. 
Written Lab 

1. What are the three basic LAN topologies? 
Bus, ring, and star 

2. What common WAN topology often results in multiple connections to a single site (leading to a high degree of 
fault tolerance) and has one-to-many connections? 
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

3. What is the term for a device that shares its resources with other network devices? 
Server 

4. What network model draws a clear distinction between devices that share their resources and devices that do not? 
Client-server 

5. Which network topology or connection type can be implemented with only two endpoints? 
Point-to-point 

6. What device is generally implemented as a star topology? 
Hub or switch 

7. What does MPLS stand for? 
Multiprotocol Label Switching 

8. What does WAN stand for? 
Wide area network

9. Will a computer that shares no resources most likely be connected to the backbone or to a segment? 
A segment 

10. Which LAN topology is characterized by all devices being daisy-chained together with the devices
at each end being connected to only one other device? 
Bus
